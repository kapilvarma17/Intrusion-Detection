# Intrusion-Detection
Intrusion detection system is process which monitor the events that occur in a computer system or network. These systems analyze the signs of a possible incident or violation of the computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security policies. As information systems have become of high-value importance for organizations, therefore IDS systems have been incorporated as elements of operating systems. 

The overall aim of this project is to provide a survey of different methods and techniques to optimize the performance of an intrusion detection system using machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also provides comparison between Snort and Suricata IDS systems.

Objectives that are achieved are:

•	Analysis of signature based and anomaly-based IDS
•	Carry out an assessment of current IDS systems.
•	Review different types of Artificial intelligence and machine learning based methods to optimize IDS systems
•	Comparison of two major IDS systems: Suricata and Snort
•	Analyzing different aspects of improvement in this field
